### Next ###
Create a animal brain to evalute the next thing move, stand still , go for food, reproduce
Collision and hunting for food?






### Plans ###
-   Have animals refill their hunger number by eating the plants that grow back after x?
    roam randomly and when food is in their awareness circle they will go for it if they are 50% hungry?

-   Reproduce with awareness circle by urge witch increases by maturity
    spawn 1-3 new animals after pregnancy cycle complete
    Female rejection depending on traits?
    (future give animals traits and have either parent pass down something +/- depending on their own?)


-   Lifespan after maturity is maxed health will decline eventually death ?

-   Make the noise map work to add water/rivers etc for water source and add in water need?

-   Introduce a predator? Hunts animals (gets tired after a bit of hunting)
    Eats x animals / time ?
    Animal awareness = run away from predator? genes?
